0	6960	We had kids whose last hot meal was Friday lunch at school and they didn't eat over the weekend
6960	12720	until they got to Monday breakfast at school. That is not uncommon in Montgomery County where
12720	19440	8.9 percent of its residents were food insecure in 2021. County Executive Mark Elridge says that
19440	25520	three years later, not much has changed. The lines of people waiting for food have not gone away.
25520	31520	And it isn't a lack of food that's the problem. It's the waste of food. Americans throw away
31520	37760	nearly 40 percent of goods bought each year. That's like having 10 chicken nuggets and throwing
37760	46240	four away. And that adds up to nearly 149 billion meals getting thrown away each year in this country
46240	52800	according to Feed in America. To stop food waste, Montgomery County is partnered with
52880	57760	Mana Food Center. They say in addition to collecting food, one of their biggest challenges
57760	64720	is educating people. It's really to make a cultural shift in the nation around food waste. To
64720	71440	first bring people to an awareness about the scope of the problem and then to also offer
72640	79440	tips about how to both again reduce that food waste in your own home. Montgomery County
80000	85840	Environmental Protection Director John Monger says to make change, you don't have to change much.
85840	90720	You can start in your very own kitchen with your own shopping list, with your own meal prep,
90720	95200	with your own food storage, and it matters. It matters to our environment. Elridge knows
95200	100560	that change is hard, but he hopes Montgomery County can show others how it's done. Montgomery
100560	105920	County is not going to change the trajectory of the planet, but Montgomery County can be an example.
