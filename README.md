# speech-to-text



I realize now that I did not choose a good video, considering is has one line of actual audio, so thats my fault. I suppose it does save me a little bit of storage space in the end though. However, the AI did a great job transcribing that one line, so 10/10 experience for this use here. I will say I'm sure AI is a good tool for this sort of thing, Otter and Youtube transcripts, although wrong occasionally are very helpful tools and I'd assume this is a lot like this. So to put it simply, I think this is a great use of AI as long as you understand you will need to double check transcripts from time to time by listening yourself. Still, this will allow you to use control/command f to search for whatever it is you might be looking for in a video, which is very helpful.
