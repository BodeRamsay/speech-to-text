We had kids whose last hot meal was Friday lunch at school and they didn't eat over the weekend

00:06.960 --> 00:12.720
until they got to Monday breakfast at school. That is not uncommon in Montgomery County where

00:12.720 --> 00:19.440
8.9 percent of its residents were food insecure in 2021. County Executive Mark Elridge says that

00:19.440 --> 00:25.520
three years later, not much has changed. The lines of people waiting for food have not gone away.

00:25.520 --> 00:31.520
And it isn't a lack of food that's the problem. It's the waste of food. Americans throw away

00:31.520 --> 00:37.760
nearly 40 percent of goods bought each year. That's like having 10 chicken nuggets and throwing

00:37.760 --> 00:46.240
four away. And that adds up to nearly 149 billion meals getting thrown away each year in this country

00:46.240 --> 00:52.800
according to Feed in America. To stop food waste, Montgomery County is partnered with

00:52.880 --> 00:57.760
Mana Food Center. They say in addition to collecting food, one of their biggest challenges

00:57.760 --> 01:04.720
is educating people. It's really to make a cultural shift in the nation around food waste. To

01:04.720 --> 01:11.440
first bring people to an awareness about the scope of the problem and then to also offer

01:12.640 --> 01:19.440
tips about how to both again reduce that food waste in your own home. Montgomery County

01:20.000 --> 01:25.840
Environmental Protection Director John Monger says to make change, you don't have to change much.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.720
You can start in your very own kitchen with your own shopping list, with your own meal prep,

01:30.720 --> 01:35.200
with your own food storage, and it matters. It matters to our environment. Elridge knows

01:35.200 --> 01:40.560
that change is hard, but he hopes Montgomery County can show others how it's done. Montgomery

01:40.560 --> 01:45.920
County is not going to change the trajectory of the planet, but Montgomery County can be an example.
