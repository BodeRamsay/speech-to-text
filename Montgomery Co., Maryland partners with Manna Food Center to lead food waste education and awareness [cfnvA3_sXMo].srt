We had kids whose last hot meal was Friday lunch at school and they didn't eat over the weekend

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,720
until they got to Monday breakfast at school. That is not uncommon in Montgomery County where

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,440
8.9 percent of its residents were food insecure in 2021. County Executive Mark Elridge says that

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,520
three years later, not much has changed. The lines of people waiting for food have not gone away.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,520
And it isn't a lack of food that's the problem. It's the waste of food. Americans throw away

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,760
nearly 40 percent of goods bought each year. That's like having 10 chicken nuggets and throwing

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,240
four away. And that adds up to nearly 149 billion meals getting thrown away each year in this country

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,800
according to Feed in America. To stop food waste, Montgomery County is partnered with

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,760
Mana Food Center. They say in addition to collecting food, one of their biggest challenges

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,720
is educating people. It's really to make a cultural shift in the nation around food waste. To

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,440
first bring people to an awareness about the scope of the problem and then to also offer

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,440
tips about how to both again reduce that food waste in your own home. Montgomery County

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,840
Environmental Protection Director John Monger says to make change, you don't have to change much.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,720
You can start in your very own kitchen with your own shopping list, with your own meal prep,

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,200
with your own food storage, and it matters. It matters to our environment. Elridge knows

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,560
that change is hard, but he hopes Montgomery County can show others how it's done. Montgomery

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,920
County is not going to change the trajectory of the planet, but Montgomery County can be an example.
